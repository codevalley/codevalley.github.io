For a long time, I used to say"<span id="k">More machines, less humans</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Narayan (or Nyn in short).<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I have been lurking on the internet for couple of decades.</p>
<p>And started using a computer terminal over 30 years ago.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I have built software throughout my school days and adult hood. From publishing games and graphics libraries to <span id="k">Programmer's heaven</span> back in the 90s, to building world's largest Siri competitor in  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/23/now-you-can-ask-your-smartphone-about-the-past-present-or-future-androids-siri-like-assistant-iris-gets-integrated-with-activity-tracker-friday/"> 2010s</a>, and creating the template way before Google Now became a reality.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>I have been an entrepreneur, designer, product leader, engineering leader and in short <span id="k">jack of many trades</span> <br><br>
<br>I have played key role in creating over 500M+ DAU across consumer products like Glance, Truecaller, Iris, Friday etc.
<p> You can find me on the Internet, here: <br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyn">Linkedin</a> <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/nyn">Twitter</a> and <br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/nyn">Dribbble (from my previous life)</a>.</p>

I still love creating products, and spend time talking to startups/entrepreneurs, sharing my learnings (and invest in small capacities) <!-- slightdelayhere-->, to get in touch feel free to send me an email at<!-- longlonglongcomment --><a href="mailto:codevalley@live.com">codevalley@live.com</a>.
